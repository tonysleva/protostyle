# Who is the Elastic audience?
Our users are delightfully diverse and we need to meet them, whenever we can, in their language and on their most pressing issues. You don’t want to send a security analytics tutorial to someone who has an urgent business analytics issue. Knowing our audience and tailoring content as much as we can to meet their needs make us trustworthy and helpful.

The Elastic audience is mostly comprised of developers, but can also include folks in executive, administrative, and even marketing roles. For a more detailed look at our audience, learn about Vision.

Often we can ask questions to determine if we’re speaking to an audience that’s more or less technical, experienced or novice, or oriented towards logging or enterprise search. If you don’t know who you’re writing for, find out.
