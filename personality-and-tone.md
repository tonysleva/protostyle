# Heya, we’re Elastic: Personality and tone
So, what does it mean to sound “Elastic”? At its heart, our tone is grounded in the traits of all Elasticians, from our founders to the newest hire — authenticity, curiosity, helpfulness, humility, and ambition. We aim to be descriptive, yet concise. Conversational, yet credible. Engaging and enthusiastic, but never crazed. (We take it easy on exclamation points.)

More concretely, every piece of content we create should:

* Be helpful. Know exactly who your audience is and what problems they’re facing, then deliver relevant insight, content, or information.
* Be human. Talk like a person, not a jargon-generating computer.
* Be concise. Follow the cardinal rule of good writing: do not waste your reader’s time.
* Be clear. Being clear isn’t the same as being brief. You can write short copy that’s unclear. You can write long copy that’s easy to follow. Make it easy for your reader to understand what you’re getting at.
* Be inclusive. Our audience is diverse and global. Use inclusive language when writing about people and consider the needs of an international audience. 
* Be quirky, but with substance. We love a great, smart, punny line. But it should always be backed up with something valuable for the reader. And please remember: It’s all well and good to try and be clever with every word or thought, but often there isn’t the time, the subject doesn’t lend itself to that sort of dressing up, or it's just better said plainly.
