## What _is_ the Elastic Guide to Writing Style?

It might be helpful to introduce the Elastic Guide to Writing Style by explaining a few things the Guide is not trying to accomplish.
* The Guide is not prescriptive. Our aim here is to be helpful, not controlling. Although some of the suggestions set out in the Guide are stronger than others, we’re not going to force you to avoid split infinitives at all costs. It’s all about seeing the bigger picture rather than getting sucked into a black hole of prescriptive grammar and mechanics rules.
* The Guide is not set in stone. The Guide will continue to change as Elastic’s offerings expand and the user base grows, and as Elasticians themselves add their voices here. This is a living document.
* The Guide is not a replacement for your best judgement. There will be many cases where we can offer guidance here, but you’ll still need to rely on your best judgement to make a final call. Hopefully the Guide can act as a tiebreaker to help nudge you in the right direction.

So what are we hoping to accomplish with this Guide, then?
* We want to establish guidelines to enable Elasticians to use language in a consistent and clear way. This covers everything from whether we hyphenate cross-cluster replication to how we make sure we’re inclusive and compassionate in every piece of content that we produce.
* We want everyone to be able to get to know Elastic’s personality and tone. It’s not always easy to pin down what sounds “Elastic” and what doesn’t.
* We want everyone to understand where to go if they have comments, questions, or concerns about Elastic style. You are a big part of how we will keep the Guide up to date. Read through our Style Guide GitHub repo, comment on open issues that you care about, or open a new issue if you notice something in the Guide that’s missing or isn’t right.
