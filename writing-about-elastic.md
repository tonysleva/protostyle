# Writing about Elastic (and Elasticians)
**Do** try to use humanizing and inclusive terms like Elasticians when talking about people as employees. Where possible and appropriate, avoid impersonal terminology like heads and headcount.

**Do** use distributed rather than remote when referring to how folks work at Elastic.

**Do**  use the pronoun we to refer to Elastic rather than it (in general â€” there may be valid exceptions to this rule).
